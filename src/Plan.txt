This V1 of the MonoJ programming language

name is monoJ because i want to create new language but i dont have exe to create new compiler.
so i'm going to use java's compiler but i will create my own transpiler .

goal of this programming language are :
    easy to write
    dont focus on syntax too much
    very easy to understand
    people should treat it like java jr(lol)


goal for this first version :
    name of the language
    extension(mj,jr,jpp,jjr) i dont know yet
    first variable type(may be int or string)
    basic syntax (i have no idea right now haha)
    print syntax (show , paste , give , output or somethings else)
    input syntax (take , get , input , copy or somethings else)

process that im thinking of now
    our language ---> our transpiler --> javac(im thinking may be some other lang)--> jvm (after the bytecode)


why javac ??
    right now im know java the best and i think i can do it in only java(lol)

will i regrate it ?
    yes , but that is for future saurav .

why will i regrate it ?
    our goal with monoJ is to create simple lang using java .
    and simple lang means dynamic but converting all the syntax from monoj to java will be hard and
    variable type converting will be the hardest since im using dynamic variable in monoJ and we all know how easy it is in java

For v2
    lets hope V1 works first lol.
